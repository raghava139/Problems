virtual DOM:-
---------------
---> In React.js, the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept and a technique used to improve the efficiency of updating the user interface (UI). 
---> React maintains a representation of the actual DOM in memory, known as the Virtual DOM. Instead of directly updating the real DOM every time there is a change in the application state,
---> React first updates the Virtual DOM.


Diffing:-
----------
---> short for "difference reconciliation,"
--->Diffing is the process of finding differences between two tree structures (old and new virtual DOM trees).


Reconciliation(settlement):-
---------------
---> Reconciliation, in the context of React, is the process of updating the real DOM to reflect the changes identified during the diffing process.
---> Reconciliation is the subsequent process of applying the identified differences to update the real DOM. 


NOTE:-
------
Together, these processes enable React to efficiently manage and update the user interface, 
ensuring that changes are reflected in the DOM with minimal performance overhead.
